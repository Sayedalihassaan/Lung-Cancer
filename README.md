Lung Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning Classification
Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having lung cancer based on various health indicators and demographic information. This model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and diagnosis, potentially leading to timely interventions and better patient outcomes.

Dataset Overview
The dataset consists of 310 records with 16 features, including both categorical and numerical data. The target variable is LUNG_CANCER, which indicates whether the individual has been diagnosed with lung cancer (YES or NO).

Features
The features in the dataset include:

Age: Age of the individual
Gender: Gender of the individual (Male/Female)
Smoking: Smoking status (Yes/No)
Yellow_Fingers: Presence of yellow fingers (Yes/No)
Anxiety: Anxiety levels (Yes/No)
Peer_Pressure: Exposure to peer pressure (Yes/No)
Chronic_Disease: Presence of chronic disease (Yes/No)
Fatigue: Experience of fatigue (Yes/No)
Allergy: Presence of allergies (Yes/No)
Wheezing: Experience of wheezing (Yes/No)
Alcohol_Consuming: Alcohol consumption status (Yes/No)
Coughing: Experience of coughing (Yes/No)
Shortness_of_Breath: Experience of shortness of breath (Yes/No)
Swallowing_Difficulty: Difficulty in swallowing (Yes/No)
Chest_Pain: Experience of chest pain (Yes/No)
Lung_Cancer: Diagnosis of lung cancer (Yes/No) - target variable
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model to predict lung cancer using various health indicators and demographic information. The resulting model can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding early detection and diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
